# Binance-Agent-Automatic-Trader-and-Organizer-

I implemented this project in 2019 at Hoosh Pardaz. I have recently added a number of my public projects to my github. 

This program connects to binance, does a trade and receives the data. It is able to store orderbook and tick-data. The program also has the option of using web socket management for handling larger data.
